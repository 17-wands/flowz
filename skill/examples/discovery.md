# Workflow: Discovery & Requirements

This workflow covers user research synthesis through PRD sign-off.
Load this file when working on discovery tasks, design decisions, or requirements writing.
See `workflow.md` in the project root for the full workspace manifest.

## Conventions

- `actor: human` — must be performed by a person
- `actor: agent` — can be fully delegated to an AI agent
- `actor: either` — human or agent, at the team's discretion
- `enforcement: required` — this step must be completed before proceeding
- `enforcement: recommended` — skip only with documented justification
- `enforcement: optional` — use at team discretion
- `alternatives` — acceptable substitutes when the primary tool is unavailable
